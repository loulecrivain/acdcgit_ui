# Git Updater GUI

Git Updater GUI is a program aiming to make the life of those who
use a lot of git repositories easier.
It allows various operations on repositories such as:
- updating them
- viewing their state
- commiting changes
Furthermore, it can discover repositories by scanning a filesystem
or reading a cache file.

This client is built on top of the libraries provided by the git-updater project.


# Building and running the GUI

You can build the GUI using Eclipse export tools ('runnable JAR'). Then, you
can launch it using jexec (see OpenJDK or Java SE documentation).
